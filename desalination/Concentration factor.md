Describes amount of fresh water which can be extracted from salt

$$CF = \frac{x_B}{x_F} = \frac{\dot{m_F}}{\dot{m_B}}$$
$$x_B \approx 60,000 \frac{mg}{L}$$
$$\phi = \frac{CF-1}{CF}$$
x -> salt concentration
m -> mass flow rate
B -> brine
F -> feed
$\phi$ -> [[Recovery rate]]

1 ppt = 1 psu = 1000 mg/L
