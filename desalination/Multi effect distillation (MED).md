Energy consumption of single stage thermal desalination plant with no heat recovery

$$\frac{\dot{Q}_{H}}{\dot{m}_{D}}=\Delta h_{V, T_{V}}+\frac{C F}{C F-1} \cdot c_{P} \cdot\left(\Delta T_{P H}+\Delta T_{B P E}\right)$$

Energy consumption of single stage thermal desalination plant with recovery heat from condensate
$$\frac{\dot{Q}_{H}}{\dot{m}_{D}}=\Delta h_{V, T_{V}}+\frac{C F}{C F-1} \cdot c_{P} \cdot\left(\Delta T_{TTD}+\Delta T_{B P E}\right)$$

Q_H -> Heat energy input
m_D -> Mass flow of distillate
CF -> Concentration factor
c_p -> Heat capacity
h_v,tv -> Enthalpy of vaporization of water at its boiling point (Kucera uses 100C, but seems like it should be evaluated at the boiling point of salty water?)
T_v -> temperature of boiling for pure water
T_PH -> T_v - T_ambient, temperature to get water to standard boiling point
T_TTD -> T_v - temperature difference at outlet of heat exchanger. Roughly 2-6K (Kucera 2.2.1)
T_BPE -> Increase in boiling point due to water saltiness, boiling point elevation
