For a vector field $\mathbf F$ in cartesian coordinates, with $F = \left( F_x, F_y, F_z, \right)$ 

The divergence is simply the dot product of the [[del operator]] with the vector field
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial y} + 
\frac{\partial F_z}{\partial z}$$

A physical meaning is that the divergence of a vector field is the rate at which density enters and exits a certain area. The concept of continuity is stated formally in the [[Divergence theorem]]
