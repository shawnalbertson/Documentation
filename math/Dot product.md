For two vectors $\mathbf X$ and $\mathbf Y$, the dot product is a measure of their parallel-ness. It's the length of $\mathbf X$ projected onto the unit vector $\mathbf{\hat{Y}}$ . Can be found a number of ways

$$\mathbf X \cdot \mathbf Y = |\mathbf X||\mathbf Y|\cos\theta$$ 
where $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors.

A bit more easily to facilitate over calculation, 

$$\mathbf X\cdot \mathbf Y = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i = x_i y_i$$
