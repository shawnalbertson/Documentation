First zettel
------------

There is a whole theory/ framework about how to `structure a zettelkasten <https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/>`_. Readthedocs is a perfect tool. Cross-referenceable, searchable, source controlled (that’s probably unnecessary). As a tool it has everything I would need, but really it’s a practice. It only works if I use it, practice it, pursue it. Which I want to do. But one thing I did take away from reading the Introduction to zettelkasten is the point that it is something to create for yourself, which is different than something you migth allow everyone to see. 

I've just tried setting a notification reminder for myself to add to this every day. I hope to make it a habit and get to the point where I can refine my process for using readthedocs as a platform.
