sigma = density - 1000
alpha (specific volume) = 1 / density
fresh water is densest at 4C

**potential temperature** is the temperature a water parcel has when moved adiabatically to another pressure. It removes the effect that a fluid/gas moving from higher to lower pressure cools, and lower to higher pressure heats up. It is usually referenced to the ocean surface, so the potential temperature is almost always less than the actual temperature unless it is already at the surface.

**potential density** is the density of seawater when moved adiabatically to a reference pressure. potential temperature is used, while salinity is generally viewed as independent of pressure.

absolute salinity - the amount of dissolved matter in seawater. practical salinity unit (psu) is number of grams of salt in a kg of seawater
