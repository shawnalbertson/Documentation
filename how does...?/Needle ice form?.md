Needle ice forms when air temps are below freezing and ground temps are above freezing. 

result of a process called [[ice segregation]]
### Ice segregation
- saturated soil, freezing air temps
- top layer freezes, is pushed above the soil due to expansion
- capillary action draws more water up to the freezing layer, and freezes upon contact
- 


Water at the surface freezes and is extruded through porous soil, while water below is drawn to the surface due to the absence of water, and eventually freezes on the bottom layer of the growing ice column
