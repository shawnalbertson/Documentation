The volume integral of the divergence in a volume is equal to the projection of the vector quantity integrated over the surface boundary. 

$$\int_V \left( \nabla \cdot \mathbf F \right) dV = \int_S F \cdot dS$$

Expression of continuity. The density in a region can only change if it flows in our out of the material boundary
