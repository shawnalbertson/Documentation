Dominant steepness
$$H_s / L_p$$
Or, we can scale this by a factor $\pi$ with the similar expression $$a_s k_p = \frac{H_s}2\frac{2\pi}{L_p} = \frac{H_s\pi}{L_p}$$
Spectral steepness
$$\int_0^{\infty}\frac{H(\omega)}{L(\omega)}d\omega$$
Or similarly, a discrete formulation scaled by $2\pi$
$$S = \Sigma_n a_n k_n$$
