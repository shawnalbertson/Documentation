Flows are allowed in and out of system

[[Entropy]] change for an open system
$$\Delta S_{total} = \Delta S_{sys} + \Delta S_{surr}$$
- Total entropy is sum of entropy inside system and outside of system
$$\Delta S_{total} \geq 0 $$
- After any process, the total entropy in the universe increases
	- Reversible processes approach zero change in entropy
