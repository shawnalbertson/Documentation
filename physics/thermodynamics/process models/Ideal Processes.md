## Irreversible vs. reversible
Irreversible -> losses in processes
- friction
- free expansion
- heat transfer that is not isothermal
- mixing

Reversible
- The system and surrounding can be exactly restored to the initial states after the process has taken place. 
- Relationship to work
- For a system *doing* work, maximum amount of work done between two states
- For work *done to* a system, minimum amount of work needed to get between two states
- If no heat exchanged (adiabatic), then there is no change in entropy


Internally reversible
- No irreversibilities *within* the system
- example internal irriversibilities/
	- friction (within system)
	- free expansion
	- heat transfer that is not isothermal (within system)
	- mixing
- Internally reversible processes have to be in Quasi-equilibrium

Externally reversible
- No irreversibilities at boundary of system
- ex/ 
	- friction at boundary
	- heat transfer at boundary - not isothermal
