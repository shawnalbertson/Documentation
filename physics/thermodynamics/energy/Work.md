To find work done by the expansion of a gas
$$W = \int_1^2 P dV$$
- Work is path dependent, the area under the pressure-volume curve for expanding gases

[[Isochoric]] - constant volume
$$W_{12} = 0$$

[[Isobaric]] - constant pressure
$$W_{12} = P(V_2 - V_1)$$

[[Polytropic]] $PV^n = C$
$$W_{12} = \int_1^2 \frac{C}{V^n} dV$$

Relationship to [[Entropy]]
- Area bounded by [[T-S diagram]]
