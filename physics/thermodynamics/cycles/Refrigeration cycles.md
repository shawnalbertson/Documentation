[[Heat Pump cycles]]

To be a refrigeration cycle, $Q_{out}  >Q_{in}$
$$W_{cycle} = Q_{out} - Q_{in} $$

Aims to cool a body. In the example of a refrigerator, $Q_{in}$ is heat from food to refrigerant, so [[Thermal efficiency]] is 
$$\beta = \frac{Q_{in}}{W_{cycle}}$$
$$\beta = \frac{Q_{in}}{Q_{out} - Q_{in}}$$



## Refrigeration
Aims to cool a body. In the example of a refrigerator, $Q_{in}$ is heat from food to refrigerant
$$W_{cycle} = Q_{out} - Q_{in} $$

Coefficient of Performance
$$\beta = \frac{Q_{in}}{W_{cycle}}$$
$$\beta = \frac{Q_{in}}{Q_{out} - Q_{in}}$$

Theoretical maximum efficiency
$$\beta_{max} = \frac{T_C}{T_H - T_C}$$
