# Entropy

- A measure of disorder
	- More disordered -> high entropy
- A measure of the quality of the energy
	- Low quality of energy -> high entropy
- A measure of how reversible a process is


[[Isentropic]] means zero change in entropy
- Must be both [[Adiabatic]] & [[Reversible process]]

Two ways to change entropy in a system
1. Heat transfer to/from the system
	- Same addition of heat in a low temperature environment creates a larger change in entropy
2. Internal irreversibilities





## [[Open system]]
$$\Delta S_{total} = \Delta S_{sys} + \Delta S_{surr}$$
- Total entropy is sum of entropy inside system and outside of system
$$\Delta S_{total} \geq 0 $$
- After any process, the total entropy in the universe increases
	- Reversible processes approach zero change in entropy

## [[Closed system]]
$$S_2 - S_1 = \int_1^2 \frac{\partial Q}{T} + \sigma_{gen}$$  
$\sigma_{gen} < 0$ -> Impossbile
$\sigma_{gen} > 0$ -> [[Irreversible process]]
$\sigma_{gen} = 0$ -> [[Reversible process]]  


## Equations
For a reversible process
$$S_2 - S_1 = \frac{Q}{T}$$
For a solid
$$\Delta S = mc \ln\frac{T_2}{T_1}$$
