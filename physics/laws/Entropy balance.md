# Second Law: [[Entropy]] balance
Clausius statement: 
- Heat transfer cannot spontaneously transfer from cold to hot
Kelvin-Planck Statement:
- No [[Thermodynamic cycle]] can exist without a cold sink


- The [[Entropy]] of the universe is increasing


For a [[Closed system]]
$$S_1 - S_2 = \int_1^2 \frac{\partial Q}{T_b} + S_{gen}$$
