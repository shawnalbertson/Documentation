inviscid, irrotational flow

the velocity potential $\phi$ defined for irrotational flows $$\nabla \phi = \mathbf u$$
### justifying the definition

irrotational means
$$\nabla \times \mathbf u = 0$$
so by definition
$$\nabla \times \nabla \phi = 0$$
### laplace's equation

thanks to [[Conservation of mass]] for an incompressible fluid,  
$$\nabla u = 0 = \nabla^2 \phi$$
### result

$\phi(x,y,z,t)$ replaces the three velocity components necessary for the more basic (unsimplified) case
