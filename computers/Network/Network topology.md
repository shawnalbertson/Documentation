The arrangement of [[Nodes]] and [[Links]] in a [[Computer Network]]

### Bus topology
Each node connected to one other node. Data transmission occurs in one direction only
### Ring topology
Each node connected to two other nodes (forming a ring). Unreliable since if one node fails it can bring down the whole system
### Star topology
One central node (i.e. server) connects to many other nodes (i.e. clients)
### Mesh topology
Every node connected to many other nodes. Full mesh implies all nodes connect to every other node
