## Entropy
Ways to think about entropy
- A measure of disorder
	- More disordered -> high entropy
- A measure of the quality of the energy
	- Low quality of energy -> high entropy
- A measure of how reversible a process is

Isentropic means zero change in entropy
- Must be both adiabatic & reversible

Two ways to change entropy in a system
1. Heat transfer to/from the system
	- Same addition of heat in a low temperature environment creates a larger change in entropy
2. Internal irreversibilities

Closed system
$$S_2 - S_1 = \int_1^2 \frac{\partial Q}{T} + \sigma_{gen}$$  
$\sigma_{gen} < 0$ -> Impossible
$\sigma_{gen} > 0$ -> Irreversible
$\sigma_{gen} = 0$ -> Reversible   

## pressure
## volume
## specific volume
## mass
## temperature
## enthalpy
## saturated pressure
## saturated temperature

## saturation state
## phase
## Osmotic pressure
For temperatures near 25C
$$\Pi = P_{os} = cRT$$
c -> concentration of solute
R -> Universal Gas Constant
T -> Temperature


## universal gas constant
$$ R = 8.3145 \left[ \frac{J}{K*mol} \right]$$
$$ R = .0821 \left[ \frac{L*atm}{K*mol} \right]$$
