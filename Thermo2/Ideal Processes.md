## Irreversible vs. reversible
Irreversible -> losses in processes
	- friction
	- free expansion
	- heat transfer that is not isothermal
	- mixing
	
Reversible
- The system and surrounding can be exactly restored to the initial states after the process has taken place. 
Relationship to work
- For a system *doing* work, maximum amount of work done between two states
- For work *done to* a system, minimum amount of work needed to get between two states
- If no heat exchanged (adiabatic), then there is no change in entropy


Internally reversible
- No irreversibilities *within* the system
- example internal irriversibilities/
	- friction (within system)
	- free expansion
	- heat transfer that is not isothermal (within system)
	- mixing
- Internally reversible processes have to be in Quasi-equilibrium

Externally reversible
- No irreversibilities at boundary of system
- ex/ 
	- friction at boundary
	- heat transfer at boundary - not isothermal


## Carnot cycle
- carnot refrigeration
- The most ideal Thermodynamic cycle
- Composed of four reversible processes, no internal or external irreversibilities
	- isothermal heat addition/ rejection
	- Adiabatic and Reversible process expansion and compression 
		- Isentropic!!

[[Engineering Metrics]]
- Thermal efficiency
$$\eta = \frac{W}{Q_H} = \frac{Q_H - Q_C}{Q_H} = 1 - \frac{Q_C}{Q_H}$$
$$\frac{Q_C}{Q_H} = \frac{T_C}{T_H}$$
$$\eta = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}$$
