## Thermodynamic cycles
"A thermodynamic cycle is a sequence of processes that begins and ends at the same state" - Moran and Shapiro 2.6
- Carnot (ideal)
- Power
- Refrigeration
- Heat Pump

Energy Balance
$$Q_{cycle} = W_{cycle}$$
- The net heat transferrered to the system is the same as the net work done by the system. As described by the second law of thermodynamics, a hot sink *and* a cold sink are necessary to describe a cycle! This is why specifying net heat is so important

To be a power cycle, $Q_{in} > Q_{out}$
$$W_{cycle} = Q_{in} - Q_{out}$$

Thermal Efficiency -> how much of  the heat input is converted to work?
$$\eta = \frac{W_{cycle}}{Q_{in}}$$
$$\eta = \frac{Q_{in} - Q_{out}}{Q_{in}} = 1 - \frac{Q_{out}}{Q_{in}}$$


## Closed system
Entropy
$$S_2 - S_1 = \int_1^2 \frac{\partial Q}{T} + \sigma_{gen}$$  

## Open system
Entropy
$$\Delta S_{total} = \Delta S_{sys} + \Delta S_{surr}$$
- Total entropy is sum of entropy inside system and outside of system
$$\Delta S_{total} \geq 0 $$
- After any process, the total entropy in the universe increases
	- Reversible processes approach zero change in entropy

## Mass continuity
## Quasiequilibrium / Quasistatic
- Modeled such that departure from thermodynamic equilibrium is at most infintesimal
- Maximum work is done
