## Work
To find work done by the expansion of a gas
$$W = \int_1^2 P dV$$
- Work is path dependent, the area under the pressure-volume curve for expanding gases

[[Process models]]
- isochoric - constant volume
$$W_{12} = 0$$

- isobaric - constant pressure
$$W_{12} = P(V_2 - V_1)$$

- polytropic $PV^n = C$
$$W_{12} = \int_1^2 \frac{C}{V^n} dV$$

Relationship to entropy
- Area bounded by TS diagram
