"A thermodynamic cycle is a sequence of processes that begins and ends at the same state" - Moran and Shapiro 2.6

Types
- [[Carnot Cycle]]
	- Theoretically most efficient thermodynamic cycle
- [[Power cycles]]
- [[Refrigeration cycles]]
- [[Heat Pump cycles]]


Energy Balance
$$Q_{cycle} = W_{cycle}$$
- The net heat transferrered to the system is the same as the net work done by the system. As described by the [[Second Law of Thermo]], a hot sink *and* a cold sink are necessary to describe a cycle! This is why specifying net heat is so important
