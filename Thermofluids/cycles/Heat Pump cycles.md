[[Refrigeration cycles]]

To be a heat pump cycle, $Q_{out}  >Q_{in}$
$$W_{cycle} = Q_{out} - Q_{in} $$

Aims to heat a body. In the example of a heat pump, $Q_{out}$ is heat emitted to a room, so **coefficient of performance** is 
$$\gamma = \frac{Q_{out}}{W_{cycle}}$$
$$\gamma = \frac{Q_{out}}{Q_{out} - Q_{in}}$$
