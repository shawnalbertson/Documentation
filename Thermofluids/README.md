This folder contains markdown files which links ideas from Thermodynamics. It is best viewed in [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/), where cross linked items can be clicked and followed. It also formats Latex equations nicely which helps me visualize some math.

It also draws a map of my ideas which I can click on and interact with. Here is a snapshot of this taken on 3/28/21. I will continue to add to this as time goes on and I would like to eventually add notes containing knowledge about fluid flow as well.
