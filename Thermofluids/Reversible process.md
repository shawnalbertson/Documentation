- The system and surrounding can be exactly restored to the initial states after the process has taken place. 
Relationship to [[Work]]
- For a system *doing* work, maximum amount of work done between two states
- For work *done to* a system, minimum amount of work needed to get between two states
- If no heat exchanged ([[Adiabatic]]), then there is no change in [[Entropy]]


## Internally reversible
- No irreversibilities *within* the system
- example internal irriversibilities/
	- friction (within system)
	- free expansion
	- heat transfer that is not [[isothermal]] (within system)
	- mixing
- Internally reversible processes have to be in [[Quasi-equilibrium]]

## Externally reversible
- No irreversibilities at boundary of system
- ex/ 
	- friction at boundary
	- heat transfer at boundary - not isothermal
