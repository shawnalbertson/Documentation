# First Law: Energy is conserved
Energy balance for a [[closed system]]
$$Q_{12} - W_{12} = E_2 - E_1$$
$$(U_2 - U_1) + \frac{1}{2}m(v_2^2 - v_1^2) + mg(z_2 - z_1) = Q_{12} - W_{12}$$

Ignoring KE and PE, writing with intensive properties
$$du = \partial q - \partial w$$

Energy rate balance for closed systems
$$\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot Q - \dot W$$

Energy balance for a [[Thermodynamic cycle]]
$$Q_{cycle} = W_{cycle}$$


E -> Total energy, sum of [[Internal energy]], [[Kinetic energy]], [[Potential energy]]
