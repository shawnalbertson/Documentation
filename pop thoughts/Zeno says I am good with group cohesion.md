While I feel that this has historically been one of my stronger traits, I don't know if I'm satisfied with this as my sole identity in a group setting. I want to be a better driver of technical content, without having to dedicate my brain's entire RAM to conceptualize complex physics. The more consistently I play with it, the easier it tends to become. Just like anything. So, what do I want to be good at? This is a practice which I have exhausted. What do I want to accomplish? More tangible. Much more tangible
