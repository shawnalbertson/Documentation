I am most familiar with the Robert Pirsig way of understanding which emphasizes the
- rational
- intuitive

Robin Wall Kimmerer said that there are four ways of knowing, to balance the purely intellectual
- Intellectual/ factual
- Spiritual
- Emotional
- Physical

Joshua Schrei argues that the rational and intuitive ways of knowing are a false division and the invention of rationality is the true illusion.
