I resent your kind, I want to feast on the smell of your fear. I come from another planet and have worked twelve years while you lazy children sit around and take the benefit. We're in a classrooom seting. I arrive late and share cocky banter with the teacher who is apparently not human. Jas is with me. We take our seats in this cramped sort of car situation. Starts lecturing and the teacher is the Berez mother and things are going fine. She writes an equation on the board. Now its the alien again asking us what it means. Yelling at us up close which is scary to see head on but I feel protected completely since I am in this car thing, and never worry that I am in danger. He invites us to the next round and disappears, those who are brave enough venture forward and follow in a group down to a ceremonial space. We pour ourselves a dark syrupy liquid which is apparently ayahuasca. In my mind I think, "I know this is ayahuasca". I wake up. 

Previously, I dream I'm being chased. I pull my car half out and then start running, even though my car is blocking the road and I would get a ticket. I pass by a man with a dog and the dog is excited when he smells me. Then a man turns the corner with a gun presed into my chest and asks who am I, they've been following me, but the way I drive they have not been able to track me down. I have the impression that they had been responsible previously for cracking my window.
