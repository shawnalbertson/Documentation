what's the difference between composer bernstein and conductor bernstein? 

Well I suppose it's the difference between any creative and any performer, where any performer ... leads a kind of public life, and extrovert life ... whereas

 **a creative person alone in a studio and writes all by themselves and communicates with the world in a very private way and lives a rather grand inner life rather than a grand outer life.** 

and if you carry around both personalities I suppose that means you become a schizophrenic and that's the end of it
