- Crack the code about the missing turbulence
- Improved climate models with better access to ocean data

If I don't answer this, then I am destined to be a cheerleader for every other cause which comes my way

- A colony on a floating island of trash
- Promote ecosystem health by consolidating ocean plastic into bundles onto which things can grow

I need to transition out of the grad school mindset of what I want to learn, and into the mindset of what I want to achieve. I am mostly focused on what I want to *become*, which admittedly has a hefty dose of wisdom. The only issue is perhaps that I tend to frame my own growth in a personal and as a result a selfish sort of way. Shaping myself even to state that I want to become a giver is not enough, as the original motivation is still regrettably me. 

What do I want to share? What do I want to give? With the tools I have, what is my offering?

Where is art. Where is my hobby. Where is life. Where are the animals, the shared meals, the laughter. I have wandered down some new paths in life, to the point where coming home feels strange, like a challenge. All the things I saw as normal when I was growing up and which have been turned upside down by a thorough education of the world. The complacency my parents take with issues that have now been adopted and forgotten as issues, I challenged myself by venturing outside of this and I challenge myself by going back. Sarah and I both had enough momentum to leave this world and to see outside of it and to find something which is there. Perhaps not which can be sumarized in a few words but which is certainly there. A world of passion, of understanding, of beauty, expression, emotion. Everything here was bred to be dull, numbing to the senses, as if the world doesn't deserve to be dug into. And so I have learned that there are other ways, as did sarah, while caroline is still here living somewhere in between, in a ruthless dependence on my parents which offers her no tools for getting out. 

Anyways. Going on a tangent because what the heck am I even asking? There's a world out there and I'm aware of it. But I can't seem to figure out what I want to do in it. I guess there's nothing totally wrong with wanting to become something, but the issue is that the things I want to become don't lend themselves very well to process, as they are in fact results based identities.

I want to be a good skiier --> I want to ski Baker
I want to be a good engineer --> I want to inform glider piloting by informing it with fluid simulations
I want to be a good physicist --> I want to contribute to this problem that we don't understand fully the breadth of turbulence in the ocean
I want to be a good programmer --> I want to build an AI which can play blokus. I want to build onto the Waterlily fluids simulator by adding surface equations
I want to be a good runner --> I want to run a half marathon. And a marathon. On trails.
I want to be a good climber --> I want to be able to lead 5.12 in the gym. I want to learn trad.
I want to be more creative --> I want to practice painting, and paint 2-3 times/ week

I look at these and I see how generic they are. It's sometimes frustrating to think that after all these lessons, I'm still aspiring to be just like everyone else? Remember when Jasmine and I were talking about living together, how we said we can do anything. Like raise ostriches in Romania. It feels like I am putting that on hold, so I can achieve... and yet so poorly have I stated up to this point what it is I am trying to achieve. These are important practices. What else? What feels harder?

I want to be a good sax player --> I want to be able to improvise across scales and sound like I mean it
I want to ride a two wheeler of some kind from alaska to chile
I want to spend time every day doing something that feels necessary for my own survival. 

Flashback to that moment in June of 2020. I could stay home and learn to build with my hands and make money and love Pearl. I chose not to. The whole world was fucking exploding anyways so how was I going to just sit there and not explode with it, caution and comfort to the wind is this what it means not to like my bed. What an ego stoking moment for me, buying a plane ticket and launching myself into the unknown, spurning this sweet easy feeling for the romantic notion of the sea. 

Remember that time when we broke up and Nate was impressed. All he'd heard about me was of this relationship, and then of me ending it and spending the entirety of the following week up at the same hour so that I could get my own rhythm back. What a guy I must have been, so put together, to strong. 

And all this time I've learned not how to accomplish something but just to push and tear at my comfort zone. At becoming something bigger, different, more experienced, so that at some point if ever maybe somehow then I could push through and do it with ferocity and unparalleled execution. But gone too far does it end with me simply becoming the transition state, forgetting to come back to the present, as if the dynamic wasn't inherently oscillatory, as if I had a choice to begin with, and my decisions aren't leading me down some back alley towards this final destination. As generic as my goals may be, generically white male in this era 2023, none of them seem too hard when you put them on paper and think ahead. It's just a matter of sticking that carrot out in front of you at just the right heading and recognizing that you may never get there.
