Why is that the further I want to push my own technical strengths, the more isolated I imagine them making me. This was the psyche that I need to outgrow from URI. The art of math and physics and engineering are not separate from society. It's what Olin was saying the whole time. But at Olin I didn't really see myself as an engineer except for in an abstract sense, and at URI I forgot what engineering in the social context was supposed to look like.
